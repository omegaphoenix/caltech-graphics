Press 'f' to apply implicit fairing
You will see "Done smoothing" output once it is finished

Part 1 Code: mostly in the model, parser, and halfedge files
Part 2, 3, 4: mostly in implicit_fairing with explanation in implicit_fairing.cpp

Overview
arcball was not functionally changed from HW3
camera, geometric_transform, model_transform were not functionally changed
  and are just used for parsing the files into data types
structs now contains the common data structures (Vertex, Normal, etc.)
opengl_renderer has the main function and was updated to handle the extra
  argument and the implicit fairing command (press the 'f' key)
